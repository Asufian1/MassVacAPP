# MassVacAPP
We are planning to prepare a mass vaccination site. A part of the plan is developing a software application to manage the appointments. The operators of the site need to search for people who have booked an appointment for receiving vaccine. People can book a time slot, or can cancel the appointment. Then, upon making the appointment nurse practioners verify the information, assign a vaccine serial number to the patient and insert the patient inormation into the system. The main operations in the system are insertion, search, and removal. Since the efficiency of operations is extremely important, we have decided to use a hash table to store and manage the information. Your task is to develop this data structure. The data structure uses patients' names as key values, we know that this can cause collisions and clustering in a hash table, since there are many common names. To increase efficiency, we use different collision handling policies. The application can change the table size, and the collision handling policy based on some specific criteria. When a change is required we need to rehash the entire table.
